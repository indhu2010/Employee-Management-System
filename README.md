Project Description:
The project demonstrated the process of building a robust employee management system using modern web technologies such as React and Node.js.
Through the integration of MySQL database, Axios for data transmission, JWT for authentication, and React for frontend development, a fully functional system was developed.
Features such as CRUD operations on employee records and categories, image uploading, and dashboard summary provided comprehensive management capabilities.
This project serves as a practical example for developers looking to build similar systems and showcases the power and flexibility of React and Node.js in web application development.


Tools and technologies:

•	React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

•	Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

•	MySQL: Relational database management system for storing employee data.

•	Axios: HTTP client for transmitting data between server and client.

•	JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Token-based authentication mechanism for secure user authentication.

•	Hash functions: Used for encrypting sensitive data such as passwords.
